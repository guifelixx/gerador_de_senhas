# Password generator üîê

This program generates passwords of 8 to 15 characters randomly, forming a robust and difficult to discover password, in this amount you will find: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

## Explanation

Just like my previous project, I used the Tkinter library (Actually a much better version of this lib which is CustomTkinter). all the logic is encapsulated in functions, and I give life to these functions using the attributes that this lib provides me, making them more beautiful and customizable. And obviously it was made 100% in Python.
